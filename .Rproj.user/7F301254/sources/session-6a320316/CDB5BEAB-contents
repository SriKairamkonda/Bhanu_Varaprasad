***The summary statistics provide insights into the key characteristics of the dataset related to red variants of Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. The physicochemical properties of the wines vary across the sampled instances. The mean fixed acidity is 8.311, with a range from 4.6 to 15.9. Volatile acidity ranges from 0.12 to 1.58, with a mean of 0.5313. Citric acid content ranges from 0 to 1, with a mean of 0.2684. Residual sugar has a mean of 2.532 and ranges from 0.9 to 15.5. Chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol also exhibit varying ranges and means. The quality scores, ranging from 3 to 8, have a mean of 5.657. The dataset comprises 1598 instances, with an 'Id' column ranging from 0 to 1597. The summary provides a concise overview of the dataset's central tendencies and variability, laying the foundation for further exploration and modeling.***
