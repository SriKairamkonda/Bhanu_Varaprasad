***`I'm Bhanu Varaprasad, experienced With 2.5 years of experience in data analytics at HCL Technologies, I decided to pursue a master's in advanced data analytics at the University of North Text to elevate my skills. My academic journey includes a strong foundation in mathematics, diverse coursework, and hands-on experience in programming languages such as C, and Java, and data analysis tools like Python, R, and Tableau. I actively participated in technical projects, and seminars, and honed my skills in areas like LIMS, ERDS, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As a full-time student, I dedicate my time to assignments, skill enhancement, and fitness. Both professionally and personally, I leverage analytics for personal growth, family business, travel, and healthcare. With a focus on deep learning and AI techniques, I aim to become an expert in data analytics and contribute to top-tier organizations.`***
